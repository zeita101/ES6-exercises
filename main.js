//Exercise #1
// Define two arrays, evens and odds filled with even 
// and odd numbers
// Using the spread operator, make a new
// array with numbers that contains all of the evens and odds



//Exercise #2
// Define an object favoriteFoods that has keys representing three of 
// your favorite foods and the values should be the restaurant where
// they are from
// Make another object and do the same thing but ask your 
// imaginary friend what their favorite foods are. 
// Use the spread operator to build a final allFoods with the 
// items from the two objects you just built



// Exercise #3
// Define your favorite movie character in an object
// with three keys: name, age, and hometown
// Use destructuring to extract all three keys into variables
// log all three variables
// Use the spread operator to extract two of the keys but not the third
// store and log this new set of variables
// Now we are going to give this person a pet
// Use destructuring to do the following
// 1) add a pet object to your person
// 2) define three variables (age, breed, name) outside of the object
// 3) add those variables to your pet
// log the most important thing about it: the pet's name
